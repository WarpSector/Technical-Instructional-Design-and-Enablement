# Core Instructional Design Philosophy and Methodology
## 📜 My Philosophy
I approach instructional design as a process for ***engineering human performance***. By treating instructional design frameworks like ADDIE and 4-MAT as learning systems architecture, I build scalable enablement pipelines that minimize cognitive friction during the learning process. I've outlined my process below.
<br><br/>
## 🎻 Orchestrating the Learning Development Lifecycle
### ADDIE & MVI
  * I implement and execute these instructional design and development lifecycle frameworks to build effective training events and "in-the-flow of work" enablement solutions.
<br><br/>
     * **`Analyze-Design-Develop-Implement-Evaluate (ADDIE):`** The ADDIE framework is implemented for building formal and structured event-driven learning solutions such as virtual instructor-lead trainings (VILT), instructor-led trainings (ILT), solo e-learnings, hands-on labs & simulations, case studies, and peer-to-peer learning "bootcamps".
<br><br/>
     * **`Minimum Viable Instruction (MVI):`** For agile design cycles, I use what I like to call ***Minimum Viable Instruction (MVI)*** enablement solutions for “just-in-time” and “in-the-flow of work” bite-sized consumable learning artifacts including microlearnings, short videos, Github "docs-as-code", job aids, and quick reference guides (QRGs).
<br><br/>
## 📐 Designing the Learning Blueprint
### 4-MAT
  * I apply the **4-MAT Structure** (WHY, WHAT, HOW, WHAT-IF) to map the learner’s journey through the learning event or enablement solution.
<br><br/> 
  * 4-MAT is ***elastic:*** it is applicable for building formal and structured event-driven (scaled up) learning solutions and for building "in-the-flow-of work" (scaled out) enablement solutions.
<br><br/>
## ⚛️ Optimizing the Learning “Physics” Engine
### Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)
  * By treating the learner’s attention and working memory as a highly constrained compute resource (RAM), I strive to filter out cognitive overload and ensure long-term retention by balancing *intrinsic*, *extraneous*, and *germane* cognitive load when building learning solutions.
<br><br/>
    * **`Intrinsic and Extraneous Load Balancing:`** “Cleaning” and structuring complex data and information into easily digestible input chunks and learning pathways so human working memory is not overwhelmed (i.e., experiencing a buffer overrun).
<br><br/>
    * **`Germane Load Balancing:`** Dedicating maximum attention to immediate hands-on application of learning materials during event-driven training (re: knowledge checks, hands-on labs/simulations, activities, peer-to-peer learning) and when consuming enablement solutions "in-the-flow-of-work" (re: step-by-step instructions, visual workflow diagrams, output validation signals to look for).

## 🏗️ Building the Enablement Pipeline
### 70/20/10 Learning Ecosystem
  * **`70% - "In-the-Flow of Work" Enablement Solutions:`** This is the ***immediate*** “experiential layer” of the learning ecosystem where just-in-time MVI enablement solutions (re: “firmware updates”) are provided to remove blockers, thus avoiding the friction of context switching to a formal event-driven training session or a solo e-learning course.
<br><br/>
  * **`20% - Communities of Practice:`** This is the “social layer” of the learning ecosystem where knowledge transfer occurs informally between peers, supported by infrastructure like Slack/Teams/Discord channels or informal micro-events like informational office hours, SME-led technical debriefs, and peer reviews.
<br><br/>
  * **`10% - Formal, Structured Event-Driven Training Sessions:`** This as the “boot sequence” of the learning ecosystem to initialize baseline knowledge and skills and where scaled up event-driven training sessions are built and deployed. This "baseline layer" is the foundation of the learning ecosystem upon which the "experiental" and "social" layers exist.

## 🤖 Tooling & AI Transparency
The core instructional design philosophy, methodology, and application of frameworks detailed in this repository are my original concepts and reflect my professional practice. To build this documentation repository, I utilized AI as a technical pair-programmer to refine the Markdown syntax, standardize/translate the ID-Engineering lexicon, and to generate the boilerplate Mermaid.js data visualizations.
