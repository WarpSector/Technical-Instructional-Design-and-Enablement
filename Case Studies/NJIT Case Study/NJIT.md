# 🚀 Enterprise SaaS Replatforming & Disaster Recovery: The NJIT Canvas Migration
## 🌐 Executive Summary & The Bottom Line
### The Impact
I co-led the successful enterprise-wide replatforming from a legacy, open-source learning management system (Moodle) to a cloud-native SaaS environment (Canvas) for a polytechnic university. When the COVID-19 pandemic forced an immediate global lockdown, our proactive data migration strategy and rapid enablement pipelines allowed over 300 faculty stakeholders and 11,000+ end-users (students) to pivot to 100% remote synchronous learning overnight without dropping the system or losing educational continuity. For our execution during this crisis, our team was awarded the **[2020 Board of Overseers Excellence in Service Award](https://www.njit.edu/provost/award-winners-convocation-2020)**.
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

## 🚨 Overview & The Challenge
In the late 2010s, the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)** faced a critical infrastructure challenge: its legacy Learning Management System (Moodle) was outdated, creating friction for end-users and bottlenecking the institution's ability to scale modern digital learning.
<br><br/>
### The Original Business Goal
Execute a phased selection, UAT pilot, and implementation of a modern, cloud-native SaaS LMS to future-proof the university's technical + digital learning infrastructure.
<br><br/>
### The Black Swan Event (Amended Goal)
Towards the end of our phased rollout, the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global lockdown. The mandate shifted overnight: accelerate the adoption pipeline immediately and execute a complete transition from in-person to 100% remote learning environments to ensure business and educational continuity.
<br><br/>
### My Roles
* Instructional Designer
* SaaS Migration & Pilot Lead
* LMS System Administrator
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Pre-Incident Architecture & Proactive Migration
As the LMS Pilot Lead, my approach was rooted in a methodical, data-driven migration strategy. Long before the crisis hit, my focus was on User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and building a scalable foundation.
<br><br/>
### Data-Driven Architecture Selection
I researched and analyzed market share data, adoption velocity, and System Usability Scale (SUS) scores across higher-education institutions to build a strong, evidence-based business case for the transition to Canvas.
<br><br/>
### Proactive Data Migration
Over several months, I partnered with one other Instructional Designer to manually migrate and QA the entire catalog of university course offerings from the legacy Moodle servers into Canvas. By the time the pandemic hit, we had successfully provisioned **~99% of the enterprise nodes**, ensuring the new infrastructure was fully loaded and ready for immediate deployment.
<br><br/>
### Enablement Roadmap
Anticipating the need for scalable onboarding, I designed and deployed self-paced enablement tutorials for both faculty (creators) and students (end-users). This self-serve documentation acted as a critical buffer, drastically reducing support tickets during the transition.

## ⚡ Phase 2: Incident Response & Rapid Scaling (The Pandemic Pivot)
With the university's swift move to a 100% remote operating model, my role shifted from migration strategy to front-line **Disaster Recovery and Incident Response**. 
<br><br/>
### Accelerated Adoption Pipeline
I provided real-time enablement, consultation, and virtual training sprints, allowing over 300 faculty stakeholders to adopt the new SaaS platform and adapt their instructional design for synchronous virtual delivery in a matter of days (and continued support thereafter).
<br><br/>
### Environment Management & LTI Integration
Unlike our legacy open-source system, the new SaaS LMS infrastructure provided dedicated `Test` and `Beta` environments. I utilized these sandbox servers to safely QA custom configurations and securely provision third-party LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) protocols via the App Center. Once validated in staging, I pushed these critical integrations to the production environment to support the remote ecosystem:
  * **Turnitin:** Plagiarism detection and academic integrity logic.
  * **Webex:** Synchronous virtual lecturing and remote communication infrastructure.
  * **ProctorU & Respondus:** Secure, remote exam proctoring environments.
<br><br/>
### Enterprise SaaS Administration
I took on the LMS Administrator role, actively managing the backend catalog of the university's course offerings, routing user permissions, and troubleshooting technical blockers in real-time to maintain system uptime.
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

## 🏆 Outcomes & Production Metrics
The successful implementation of Canvas, combined with the rapid and effective transition to remote teaching, achieved several critical outcomes: it preserved NJIT's operational continuity, positioned the institution as a highly agile organization, and established our team as leaders in technological crisis management.
<br><br/>
### Rapid Business Continuity
Enabled 300+ faculty members to rapidly pivot to remote instruction, allowing more than 11,000 students to continue their education without a single day of system interruption.
<br><br/>
### Successful Enterprise Replatforming
Culminated in the successful, 100% adoption of Canvas as the new enterprise LMS, providing a scalable, cloud-native platform that continues to serve the university's infrastructure today.
<br><br/>
### Award-Winning Incident Response
For our team's critical work in leading the technical and operational transition during the pandemic, we were honored with the **"Overseers Excellence in Service Award"** during the 2020 University Convocation.

## 🤖 Tooling & AI Transparency
The crisis management strategy, proactive data migration, and SaaS integration work detailed in this case study represent my original professional execution. To format this documentation repository, I utilized AI as a technical pair-programmer to refine the Markdown syntax, optimize the narrative structure, and standardize the enterprise ID-engineering lexicon.
